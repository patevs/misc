# Learn_C

Projects and code related to my learning of the C programming language.

> "C is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system. C is the most widely used computer language." [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/)

### Hello World Example

Example of a basic C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* Main method: program entry point */
int main() 
{
    printf("Hello C!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Compiling C Programs

In order to run a program written in C, the source code must first be compiled into an executable. The most commonly used compiler is [`GCC`](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (**G**NU **C**ompiler **C**ollection).
